### Narrative description

Biblio-retratos is a web application that allows Zotero (an open source reference manager heavily extended in academic communities worldwide) users to get various analytics and visualizations regarding their "literacy". Meaning, regarding their abilities, work, and trajectory in bibliographic reference collecting and processing. All of them, apart from consuming a tremendous ammount of time in the span of an academic career, are practices that reflect belonging, dispositions and theorical-methodological frontiers, making them an important part of an academic identity. Biblio- retratos (also known as Zotero-BR) is a project of Digital Humanities. In 2023, it received financing from Dirección de Investigación y Posgrado of Universidad Iberoamericana, Mexico City.

Note: Due to BR getting information from a remote database, query results by tags, may not match what the user visualizes in the Zotero desktop app. To verify and filter tags, go to the web version.
